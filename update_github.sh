- Add bilinear interpolation analysis (linear, cubic, nearest neighbor)  
- PINN demonstrates 3.3x better accuracy (19.7°C vs 65.7°C MAE)
- Include sensor layout and performance comparison visualizations
- Add comprehensive analysis documentation and executive summary
- Update README with quick start guide for running analysis
- 87.5% sensor reduction with superior PINN performance confirmed"
