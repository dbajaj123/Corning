# REAL Method Comparison Methodology

## 🎯 PINN Result (Your Actual Achievement)
- **MAE**: 19.7°C (documented in your project)
- **Method**: Physics-Informed Neural Network with heat equation constraints
- **Validation**: Cross-validation against 120-sensor dense data
- **Training**: 2000 epochs with physics loss weight λ=0.1

## 📏 Traditional Method Testing
- **Data**: Same 15-sensor sparse dataset from ps1_dataA_15TC.csv
- **Validation**: Leave-one-out cross-validation 
- **Methods Tested**:
  1. Simple averaging of nearby sensors
  2. Nearest neighbor prediction
  3. Distance-weighted averaging
  
## 🔍 Why Traditional Methods Struggle
1. **Sparse Data**: Only 15 sensors for complex 2D temperature field
2. **No Physics**: Traditional methods ignore heat transfer physics
3. **Edge Effects**: Poor prediction near boundaries
4. **Non-uniform Spacing**: Irregular sensor placement challenges interpolation

## ✅ PINN Advantages (Real Benefits)
1. **Physics Constraints**: Heat equation enforcement prevents unphysical predictions
2. **Smooth Interpolation**: Neural network learns complex temperature patterns
3. **Boundary Handling**: Better extrapolation beyond sensor locations
4. **Sparse Data Optimized**: Designed specifically for limited sensor scenarios
