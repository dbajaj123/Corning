## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### Why PINN Outperforms Bilinear Methods

#### 1. **Physics Integration**
```python
# PINN Physics Loss Component
physics_loss = ||∇²T - (1/α)(∂T/∂t)||²
total_loss = data_loss + λ * physics_loss
```
- **PINN**: Enforces fundamental heat equation
- **Bilinear**: No physical constraints, pure mathematical interpolation

#### 2. **Sparse Data Handling**
- **PINN**: Learns physical relationships between distant sensors
- **Bilinear**: Relies solely on geometric proximity and interpolation

#### 3. **Complex Gradient Reconstruction**
- **PINN**: Captures non-linear thermal phenomena through physics
- **Bilinear**: Linear/polynomial assumptions fail with complex gradients

#### 4. **Temporal Consistency**
- **PINN**: Maintains physical consistency across time evolution
- **Bilinear**: Each time step interpolated independently

### Error Analysis by Temperature Regime
