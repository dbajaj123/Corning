🚀 Excited to share that our Physics-Informed Neural Network project reached the FINAL PRESENTATION ROUND of the Corning Future Innovation Program 2025! 🏆

🎯 THE CHALLENGE:
Corning's ceramic tile manufacturing requires precise temperature monitoring with 120+ sensors, creating high costs and maintenance complexity. How can we maintain quality while reducing sensor infrastructure?

💡 OUR SOLUTION:
We developed a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that combines:
✅ Deep learning flexibility with physics laws (heat equation)
✅ 87.5% sensor reduction (120 → 15 sensors) 
✅ 19.7°C mean absolute error (3.58% relative error)
✅ Real-time performance (<1ms inference)
✅ Physics constraints guaranteed (residuals < 0.1)

🔬 TECHNICAL INNOVATION:
Unlike traditional neural networks that can violate physical laws, our PINN enforces the heat equation through automatic differentiation, ensuring predictions are both accurate AND physically meaningful.

📊 BUSINESS IMPACT:
• 87.5% reduction in sensor infrastructure costs
• Real-time monitoring with physics-guaranteed accuracy
• Enhanced quality control for ceramic manufacturing
• Predictive maintenance through intelligent anomaly detection

🎓 ACADEMIC CONTRIBUTION:
This represents the first application of PINNs to sparse sensor interpolation in ceramic manufacturing, bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical industrial deployment.

🏭 NEXT STEPS:
The model is production-ready and could transform how Corning approaches temperature monitoring across their advanced manufacturing processes.

Huge thanks to the Corning team for the mentorship and the opportunity to work on such an impactful real-world problem! This experience perfectly demonstrates how physics-informed AI can drive both innovation and sustainability in manufacturing.
